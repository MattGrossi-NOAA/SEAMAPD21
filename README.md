Here we present the first large-scale, fine-grained reef fish dataset from the Gulf of Mexico - the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program Dataset 2021 (SEAMAPD21).

Automated image analysis of reef fish species in challenging environments, such as coastal Gulf of Mexico, are crucial for accurate fishery monitoring and stock assessments. As advanced computer vision techniques evolve in precision and capacity, previously difficult tasks such as fish species identification and count due to strong intra-species similarities and inter-species variations, have become feasible.

SEAMAPD21 was created to enable fishery scientists and researchers to process raw image-based data at high volumes at a much quicker rate than current manual methods. This open-source dataset contains 90,000 annotations for 130 species of fish from two annual surveys done in 2018 and 2019 in strategic areas of the Gulf of Mexico using baited remote underwater video systems to assess reef fish populations. We perform baseline experiments and document predictive classification results.
